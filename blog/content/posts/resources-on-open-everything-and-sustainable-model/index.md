I discovered Linux by happenstance, during my scholarship, just before I
had to choose what Great School of Engineering I will go. It changed my
life, literally. I never had touched a computer apart for my parent's
shop accounting.

A friend came a day and tell me: Look, I discover that thing, it's
Linux, it's Free Software. And it told me about Stallman, about the idea
that willing people were just contributing together to build one of the
biggest and most amazing knowledge base of our time, that they were
building on the shoulders of our young giants, their peers. Without
arbitrary barriers, without toll.

It was so much looking like my ideal of open collaborative learning,
something I will later learn to call **symmathesy**, that I choose to go to
the school with the most computer science and Free Software I could
find. A leap of faith I still cherish today, almost 20 years later. And
who would have need one more astro-physician, really?

A couple of decades later, I'm a little less utopian about FLOSS. Oh,
I'm still sure that it's the only sane way to proceed at humanity level,
but there's so much more than software in our commons. And FLOSS is not
exempted of faults (you see --- I can't even say Free Software anymore).
I'm now more inclined to believe that the big goal is sustainability,
and that it encompass many more domains than just software development.
But just if we limit our learning to open knowledge building, there's so
much to tell! (see, I'm strong: nothing about surveillance capitalism,
nothing about privacy, nothing about democracy here!)

During these years, I read a bunch of greats resources on these subject,
and I met a whole bunch of amazing people in relation to them. In a time
when "open-something" is almost a buzzword with as much meaning than
"blockchain", it seems the right moment to share these links to others. I
hope one of them can change you life in the better as much as that
school friend did to me with a story about printer drivers (when I
didn't know exactly what a printer driver was).

And please, if you are aware of other resources on the subject, I would
love to here about it, and complete that index bit by bit. I will try to
cherry-pick and keep the list not too big, though.

## About sustainable models 

Sustainable model are the core subject of our time. Are we able to build
long term sustainable models which make thrills our ecosystems, taking
care of negative externalities ? And that, whatever the ecosystem is:
from Free Software and Knowledge to Agriculture.

### Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Prize 2009 talk: "Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of Complex Economic Systems" 

Let's start by the scientist who best studied the commons, who actually
dedicated her life to that, and show to the world that we human actually
know how to sustainably manage common pool resources.

There is a life of amazing resources from Elinor Ostrom, but her Nobel
Prize talk: "Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of
Complex Economic Systems" is a \*very\* good summary of her research and
main point, but also of the remaining open questions and what path are
explored to address them.

[https://nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/lecture/](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/lecture/)

If I only had to keep 3 take away from here work, I would settle on:

-   sustainably managed common pool resources over long periods are
    common in human history, but a recent, mostly European/Imperialist
    folklore chose to ignore (or even hide) them. The Tragedy Of the
    Commons is a self-realizing fable;
-   property, as defined in Capitalism, only cover a fraction of the
    complexity of "property", which should be defined by 5
    points:
    -   1/ *access*
    -   2/ *withdrawal*
    -   3/ *management*
    -   4/ *exclusion*
    -   5/ *alienation*
- There exists a set of common properties systematically absent from
failed common pool resources management, and almost all present in most
success:
  -   *1a. User Boundaries*: clear and locally understood boundaries
      between legitimate users and nonusers are present.
  -   *1b. resource Boundaries*: clear boundaries that separate a
      specific common-pool resource from a larger social-ecological
      system are present.
  -   *2a. congruence with local conditions*: appropriation and
      provision rules are congruent with local social and environmental
      conditions.
  -   *2b. appropriation and Provision*: appropriation rules are
      congruent with provision rules; the distribution of costs is
      proportional to the distribution of benefits.
  -   *3. collective-choice arrangements*: Most individuals affected by
      a resource regime are authorized to participate in making and
      modifying its rules.
  -   *4a. Monitoring Users*: individuals who are accountable to or are
      the users monitor the appropriation and provision levels of the
      users.
  -   *4b. Monitoring the resource*: individuals who are accountable to
      or are the users monitor the condition of the resource.
  -   *5.Graduated sanctions*: sanctions for rule violations start very
      low but become stronger if a user repeatedly violates a
      rule.
  -   *6. conflict-resolution Mechanisms*: rapid, low-cost, local
      arenas exist for resolving conflicts among users or with
      officials.
  -   *7.Minimal recognition of rights*: the rights of local users to
      make their own rules are recognized by the government.
  -   *8. nested enterprises*: When a common-pool resource is closely
      connected to a larger social-ecological system, governance
      activities are organized in multiple nested layers.

There is A LOT of other extremely important things in her work, around
polycentric decision, IAD framework, open question, etc. So just go read
that talk! (or at least the slides, if the article is a bit too
long --- it's quite intense, too).

## An Army of Ocean Farmers: On the Frontlines of the Blue-Green Economic
Revolution

(also titled: The Seas Will Save Us: How an Army of Ocean Farmers are
Starting an Economic Revolution)

This article was a revelation for me. A holistic approach to
sustainability, from social integration to sustainable agriculture and
open, collaborative knowledge for processes and seed.

{{< figure src="card-ocean-farmers.png" title="*An Army of Ocean Farmers: On the Frontlines of the Blue-Green Economic Revolution*" link="http://inthesetimes.com/rural-america/entry/18915/bren-smith-3D-ocean-farming-and-the-blue-green-economic-revolution" >}}

### Slavery 2.0 and how to avoid it: a practical guide for cyborgs

{{< figure src="card-slavery-20.png" title="*Slavery 2.0 and how to avoid it: a practical guide for cyborgs*" link="https://ar.al/2019/05/02/slavery-2.0-and-how-to-avoid-it-a-practical-guide-for-cyborgs/" >}}

OK, I missed my goal and there's a bit about surveillance capitalism and
democracy. Aral is becoming an important figure on that domain, and that
text is very well build. The last part is about sustainability, but all
the first chapters about "Ownership and control of the self in the
digital and networked age" and surveillance capitalism worth it.

## Limits of non sustainable models 

The subject is extremely vast, and I could fill that chapter with
hundreds articles on climate warming and the sixth mass extinction. I
will not (this is common knowledge I believe) and focus on two things:

1/ in free software, maintainers fatigue is real and the whole model is
not very sustainable. Our journey in with Rudder is an illustration of
that as a company, but there's also the bigger side of the free software
ecosystem and their maintenance. Do you know that a fundamental part of
software, used by almost everyone on the internet, from banks to simple
individual, was produced and maintained by one person living in poverty?
And that person was regularly insulted by said multi-billions banks
because he wasn't correcting their bugs. That's broken, rith?

### Some Trends in Open Source & the State of the Scala Center --- Heather
Miller

{{< youtube "WImJnCQhutc" >}}


2/ complex societies collapse. Always. Always? It happens some
knowledgeable people spent a lot of time studying that subject, and I
found the following book to be the best explanation of it. Conclusion:
we should really be spending thousands of billions on R&D in energy and
agriculture, in a collaborative global way. Because we are just one
complex society on the edge of collapse.

### The collapse of complex societies --- Joseph Tainter

You should really read that book, but in case that you can't get it, I
did a review on twitter here:

## About tragedy of the commons and better endings to it 

Of course, commons are central theme of open sciences, free software,
etc. And unfortunately, they are mostly know because of "the tragedy of
the commons". Fortunately, there was much work done on the subject till
the publication of the original article, and Elinor Ostrom even won a
Nobel Prize (yes, I know, not exactly that) in 2009 for her work on
sustainable commons.

### Tragedy of the commons, 50 years latter

{{< figure src="card-tragedy-commons-50yl.png" title="*Tragedy of the Commons: 50 Years Later*"
link="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/12/tragedy-of-commons-50-years-later.html" >}}

### An alternate ending to the tragedy of the commons

{{< figure src="card-alternate-ending-tragedy-commons.png" title="*An alternate ending to the tragedy of the commons*"
link="https://medium.com/@nayafia/an-alternate-ending-to-the-tragedy-of-the-commons-446b4e960887" >}}

The main points are: you can make a commons sustainable, but its users
must care for it, and fight for it.

## About open science, open data 

Finally, there's the whole subject of collaboratively building open
knowledge --- at least, that's one view of the subject.

You see, open science and open data are extremely overloaded terms. And
if you want to go the depth of the subject, and how academy are
organised, ever what are the implication in society and politics, you
will need to read Célya Gruson-Daniel thesis from december 2018.

Unfortunately (or fortunately :), it's in French, so perhaps you will need
talk with Célya directly, or look to the other resources in her github
page (http://celyagd.github.io/research/ )

"Numérique et régime français des savoirs en\~action : l'open en
sciences. Le cas de la consultation « République numérique »" .

## About symmathesy 

"A working definition of symmathesy might look like this:

Symmathesy (Noun): An entity composed by contextual mutual learning
through interaction. This process of interaction and mutual learning
takes place in living entities at larger or smaller scales of
symmathesy.

Symmathesy (Verb): to interact within multiple variables to produce a
mutual learning context."

### The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming --- Jessica Kerr

{{< figure src="card-origins-opera.png" title="*the Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming* Or: Collective problem solving in music, art, science, and software." link="https://the-composition.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming-bcdaf8fbe960" >}}

### Symmathesy: A Word in Progress --- Nora Bateson

{{< figure src="card-symmathesy.png" title="*Symmathesy: A Word in Progress*"
link="https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/" >}}

This is the reference post on the subject, from the academic who
invented the term.

I can't keep apart in my head "open science" and symmathesy. For me,
the most beautiful recent example of the result both together bring to
the world is "Homotopy Type Theory" book
([https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)). How in less than two years, a group of
mathematician created a new major math theory.

Here there's a short presentation about why it's such an achievement
that only open collaborative science could have produced:
